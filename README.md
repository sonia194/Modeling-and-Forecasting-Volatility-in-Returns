# Modeling-and-Forecasting-Volatility-in-Returns
forcasting the volatility in returns using APIs from Yahoo finance
In this project, it is about to compare the forecasting accuracy of Garch (1, 1) model with several neural network architectures, as the feed-forward neural network (FFNN), the Elman neural network (ENN), and the Jordan neural network (JNN).
For the second codde, I was looking forward to find how the volatility can be forecast with Garch and neural network including all criteeria (Correlation, MSE, Spearmann correlation and the CPD)
